## Description

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

 

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal = 8, listA = <code>[4,1,8,4,5]</code>, listB = <code>[5,0,1,8,4,5]</code>, skipA = 2, skipB = 3  
<strong>Output:</strong> Reference of the node with value = 8  
<strong>Input Explanation:</strong> The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as <code>[4,1,8,4,5]</code>. From the head of B, it reads as <code>[5,0,1,8,4,5]</code>. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

 

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal = 2, listA = <code>[0,9,1,2,4]</code>, listB = <code>[3,2,4]</code>, skipA = 3, skipB = 1  
<strong>Output:</strong> Reference of the node with value = 2  
<strong>Input Explanation:</strong> The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as <code>[0,9,1,2,4]</code>. From the head of B, it reads as <code>[3,2,4]</code>. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

 

<strong>Example 3:</strong>

<strong>Input: </strong>intersectVal = 0, listA = <code>[2,6,4]</code>, listB = <code>[1,5]</code>, skipA = 3, skipB = 2  
<strong>Output:</strong> null  
<strong>Input Explanation:</strong> From the head of A, it reads as <code>[2,6,4]</code>. From the head of B, it reads as <code>[1,5]</code>. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 

<b>Notes:</b>

## Python code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        A, B = headA, headB
        if not A or not B:
            return None
        while A != B:
            A = A.next if A else headB
            B = B.next if B else headA
        return A
```
