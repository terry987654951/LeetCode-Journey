## Description

Say you have an array for which the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day <em>i</em>.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

<strong>Note:</strong> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> <code>[7,1,5,3,6,4]</code>  
<strong>Output:</strong> 7  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>  
<strong>Output:</strong> 4  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

<strong>Example 3:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> <code>[7,6,4,3,1]</code>  
<strong>Output:</strong> 0  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if prices is None or len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return profit
```
