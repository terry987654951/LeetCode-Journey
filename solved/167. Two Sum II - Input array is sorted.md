## Description

Given an array of integers that is already <strong><em>sorted in ascending order</em></strong>, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

<strong>Note:</strong>

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.


<strong>Example:</strong>

<strong>Input:</strong> numbers = <code>[2,7,11,15]</code>, target = 9  
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>[1,2]</code>  
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

## Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            if target-numbers[i] not in dic:
                dic[numbers[i]] = i+1
            else:
                return [dic[target-numbers[i]], i+1]
```
