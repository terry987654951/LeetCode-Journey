## Description

Given an array <em>nums</em> and a value <em>val</em>, remove all instances of that value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank"><strong>in-place</strong></a> and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by <strong>modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a></strong> with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>

Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[3,2,2,3]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>3</strong>,Your function should return length = <strong>2</strong>, with the first two elements of <em>nums</em> being <strong>2</strong>.It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>2</strong>,Your function should return length = <strong><code>5</code></strong>, with the first five elements of <em><code>nums</code></em> containing <strong><code>0</code></strong>, <strong><code>1</code></strong>, <strong><code>3</code></strong>, <strong><code>0</code></strong>, and <strong>4</strong>.Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

<strong>Clarification:</strong>

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by <strong>reference</strong>, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```c++
// <strong>nums</strong> is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)  
int len = removeElement(nums, val);  

// any modification to <strong>nums</strong> in your function would be known by the caller.  
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first <strong>len</strong> elements.  
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {    
    print(nums[i]);  
}

```



## Python code

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        cur = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[cur] = nums[i]
                cur += 1
        return cur
```
